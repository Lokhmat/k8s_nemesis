1. **Easy to change the implementation algorithm in each of the modules:**

Changing the implementation algorithm is easiest in the **Pipes-and-Filters** architecture. Since each filter operates independently and communicates through standardized data streams, you can modify or replace filters without affecting the entire system. It is also not very hard in **Event driven**: it allows you to change how modules respond to events or add new event handlers without impacting the entire system. In contrast, the **Abstract Data Types** and **Main/Subroutine with stepwise refinement** methods are less flexible in this regard because of tightly coupled interactions and hard-coded control flows.

2. **Easy to change data representation:**

Changing data representation is easiest in the **Abstract Data Types** approach. This method encapsulates data within modules, and interactions occur through well-defined interfaces. As a result, you can alter the internal data structures without impacting other modules, provided the interfaces remain consistent. The **Pipes-and-Filters**, **Event-driven**, and **Main/Subroutine with stepwise refinement** methods are less supportive of data representation changes because data formats are either shared globally or embedded in the communication protocols between components, making changes more challenging.

3. **Easy to add additional functions to the modules:** 

Adding additional functions is easiest in the **Pipes-and-filters**, **Event-driven**, and **Main/Subroutine with stepwise refinement** approaches. **Pipes-and-filters** allows the addition of new filters, **Event-driven** supports new event handlers, and **Main/Subroutine** permits adding new subroutines that interact with shared data. **The Abstract Data Types** method is less flexible for adding new functions because interactions are hard-coded within modules, making extensions less easy.

4. **Performance:** 

The Abstract Data Types and Main/Subroutine with stepwise refinement methods are seemingly more performant. They provide direct data access and minimize overhead by avoiding the need for data parsing or event handling mechanisms.

5. **Reusability:** 

For a task like KWIC, I would use Pipes and Filters. It provides a good balance of modularity, flexibility, and reusability, making it easier to modify the processing algorithm and add new functionalities, despite potential performance overheads. For tasks like 8 queens, I think it's better to reuse ideas rather than code. It works great with recursion and shared data, so I think it's better to reuse ideas rather than written code for such tasks.
